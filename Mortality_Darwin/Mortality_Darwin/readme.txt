A project made for a local government.
This program computes the total sum of unique values in a .csv record. Items are paired as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and its total tally per unique record.
Contained in a vector of pairs, records are displayed in a descending order to describe which code ranks the most from the top.
A sample .csv file is included, where values are fictional.

Sample: I21	14	I21	26	I21	19	I22	27	I21	34	U07.1	53	I22	21	I22	9	U07.1	24	U07.1	70	U07.1	71	U07.1	20

Produces a summation to: 
Code:   Value:  Rank:
U07.1   238     (1)
I21     93      (2)
I22     57      (3)
