# Ray Tracing

This project utilizes the SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) library and it's associative methods to utilize and access low-level audio, keyboard, mouse, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. The goal of this project is to simulate ray tracing using pixel and lighting data. 

## Update
* July 2, 2022: Created a visual graphic variation using CApp and RhettImage classes. Colors can be varied inside the CApp class, inside the OnInit() method.

* This project is built and compiled using Visual Studio 2022. To setup and integrate the SDL Libray to Visual Studio, instructions can be found at https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php

## Future Work
This project does not have any actual ray tracing principles yet. The author plans to add camera and geometry to future work.
